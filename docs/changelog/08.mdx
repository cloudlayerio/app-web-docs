## Fixes

- Fixed the issue where a very rare bug would occur causing some jobs to randomly fail with a `Protocol Error'.
- Fixed issue in UI where you couldn't edit the details of a template if a project was assigned.
- Fixed issue in UI if you cloned a template with a name like `test-me` the rename logic would not name it correctly. It will name append the proper numbered suffix like `test-me-1`. Or if it's named `test-me-1` it will rename it to `test-me-2`, etc.
