## Template Support

We have been working on adding template support for many months, and we are extremely proud to announce it's finally here!

- Template Gallery with multiple template types.
  - PDF Invoice Templates
  - PDF Ticket Templates
  - PDF Certificate Templates
  - PDF Receipt Templates
  - Image Banner Templates
  - Image Product Review Templates

In addition to the provided templates, we have laid the ground work for users to publish their own templates. This is not yet public, but will be coming soon, after some additional testing.

## PDF Thumbnails

You can now generate PDF Thumbnails as part of the call to PDF endpoints. The thumbnails are automatically uploaded to your cloudlayer.io storage and can be accessed via our CDN.

## Image Thumbnails

You can now generate Image Thumbnails as part of the call to Image endpoints. The thumbnails are automatically uploaded to your cloudlayer.io storage and can be accessed via our CDN.
