## New Features

- Added `Pending` filter to the Jobs filters.

## Known Issues

- When a job has a timeout exception, the job will remain in `Pending` status. We are working to resolve this issue. The job should be in an error state with details about the timeout. The `Pending` filter was added to the Jobs filters to help you track these jobs.
