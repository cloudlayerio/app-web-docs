# Authentication Examples

We support two methods of authenticating your site, basic HTTP authentication with username/password and cookies. In this section, we cover examples of using both of these methods.

## Basic auth

If your URL is protected behind basic HTTP Authentication, you can pass in the username/password combination.

```json title="HttpWatch Example"
{
  "url": "https://www.httpwatch.com/httpgallery/authentication/authenticatedimage/default.aspx",
  "authentication": {
    "username": "httpwatch",
    "password": "1"
  }
}
```

In this example, the HttpWatch website will generate an image with the basic auth details. Each time the image gets generated, you must change the password to generate a new image, which produces an example that shows failing and succeeding authentication.

### cURL

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cloudlayer.io/v1/url/image \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \
  --data '{
	"url": "https://www.httpwatch.com/httpgallery/authentication/authenticatedimage/default.aspx",
	"authentication": {
		"username": "httpwatch",
		"password": "1"
	}
}'
```

## Cookie auth

Cookies can get used to create a user session creating an authenticated user state.

```shell title="cURL Cookie Example"
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cloudlayer.io/v1/url/image \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \
  --data '{
	"url": "https://www.example.com",
	"cookies": [
		{
			"name": "_session_id",
			"value": "ad9a8u90f0df7d87fdas9fa892342",
			"domain": "www.example.com",
			"path": "/",
			"expiration": 1668752280,
			"httpOnly": true
		}
	]
}'
```

_<sup>Note: The above example does not work, for security and privacy concerns we cannot provide a working example of emulating a users session via a cookie.</sup>_

You can play around with this example by using a browser plugin to examine your cookies and using those values.
