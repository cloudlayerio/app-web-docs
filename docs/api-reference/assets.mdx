# Assets

If you have storage enabled and use a plan that supports cloud storage, all PDFs, Images, etc., that you generate will be stored as an asset.

If you do not use [cloud storage](/storage#cloud-storage) and are using [no storage](/storage#no-storage) on all of your calls, there will be zero assets stored in our system. Disabling storage does not allow you to use asynchronous calls or webhooks in turn. All `v2` endpoints and up have cloud storage enabled by default.
