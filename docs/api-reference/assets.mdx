# Assets

If you have storage enabled and use a plan that supports cloud storage, all PDFs, Images, etc., that you generate will be stored as an asset.

If you do not use [cloud storage](/storage#cloud-storage) and disable it on all of your calls, assets will not get stored in our system. Using [no storage](/storage#no-storage) does not allow you to use asynchronous calls or webhooks in turn. All `v2` endpoints have cloud storage enabled by default and store assets in your account.

:::note
Legacy accounts do not support cloud storage. If you use a legacy account, you will need to upgrade it to get cloud storage.
:::
