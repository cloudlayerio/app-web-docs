All generated content is an asset. Images, PDFs, Documents, etc. is an asset.

All `v2` endpoints have cloud storage enabled by default and store assets in your account.

If you do not use [cloud storage](/storage#cloud-storage) and disable it on all of your calls, assets will not get stored in our system. Using [no storage](/storage#no-storage) does not allow you to use asynchronous calls or webhooks in turn. 

:::note
Legacy accounts do not support cloud storage. If you use a legacy account, you will need to upgrade it to get cloud storage.
:::
