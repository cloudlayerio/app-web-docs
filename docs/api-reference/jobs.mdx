# Jobs

Every time a creation or conversion endpoint gets called, a job gets generated. Each job has properties associated with it. The output of a job is an [asset](/assets). 

For example, if you are using asynchronous calls and need to check the status of a job, you could use the `GET /jobs:id` endpoint to check the status of the job by id.

The following endpoints are provided for managing jobs:

- [GET /jobs:id](#get-jobs-id)
- [GET /jobs](#get-jobs)

## Endpoints

### GET /jobs:id {#get-jobs-id}

This Endpoint returns a job by id.

### GET /jobs {#get-jobs}

This Endpoint returns a list of the ten most recent jobs.

## Job Response

### `apiKeyUsed`

### `id`

### `processTime`
