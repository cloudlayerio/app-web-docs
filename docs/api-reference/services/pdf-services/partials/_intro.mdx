cloudlayer.io supports using [Templates](template-to-pdf/), [URLs](url-to-pdf/) and [HTML](html-to-pdf/) to create PDF Documents.

## [Template to PDF](template-to-pdf/)

Use a predefined template and populate it using JSON data that gets passed into the request to generate high quality and professional PDF documents such as Invoices, Receipts, Lease Agreements, and more.

## [Url to PDF](url-to-pdf/)

Convert any URL to a PDF using a publicly accessible webpage URL or one behind basic authentication or cookie authentication using our authentication mechanisms.

## [Html to PDF](html-to-pdf/)

Convert any HTML to a PDF using any valid HTML, CSS, Javascript, SASS, etc. As long as the base64 encoded JSON payload is below 10MB in size, we will accept it and convert it.
