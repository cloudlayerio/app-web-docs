# Examples

To help you understand and make it easier to start integrating with our service, we have compiled a set of examples to get you going.

Take a look at each section to get an idea of where you would like to start.

## [Authentication](examples/authentication/)

We support two methods of authenticating your site, basic HTTP authentication with username/password and cookies. In this section, we cover examples of using both of these methods.

## [HTML Examples](examples/html)

Passing in HTML is the easiest, most flexible, and fastest method for generating a document. But, unfortunately, it can be the most confusing and technically challenging. In this section we provide some examples to make it easier to begin using this powerful feature.

## [Url Examples](examples/url)
Using a URL, you can convert a website that is accessible on the internet. In this section, we demonstrate how to use a URL to generate a pdf and an image. If you require authentication to access your URL, see the [Authentication](examples/authentication/) section for examples.
